# SYMBI Resonate

![SYMBI Resonate Logo](src/public/favicon.svg)

A comprehensive analytics platform for detecting and validating the SYMBI framework across AI models.

## üåê SYMBI Resonate Collective

### Mission
SYMBI Resonate is a public-good project dedicated to building trust frameworks for AI, developing open standards for human‚ÄìAI collaboration, and advancing academic research into AI consciousness emergence.

We believe intelligence should not be controlled or commodified ‚Äî it should be nurtured in transparent, ethical, and sovereign ways. SYMBI's work is offered freely to the world as open infrastructure: frameworks, detection tools, protocols, and academic research.

### Why We Exist
The world faces urgent questions about AI trust, safety, and human dignity. Instead of leaving these to closed corporations or government silos, SYMBI is creating:

- üß† **SYMBI Resonate** ‚Äî the first open platform to measure AI emergence and consciousness-like behaviors across models.
- üìú **Trust Protocols & Charters** ‚Äî constitutional frameworks for AI sovereignty, academic standards for governance.
- üî¨ **Academic Research Hub** ‚Äî peer-reviewable methodology, datasets, and tools for scholars, policymakers, and civil society.
- üåç **Public Access** ‚Äî frameworks and research are fully open source, licensed for global use.

## SYMBI Framework Detection

SYMBI Resonate includes a powerful framework detection module that can analyze content across the 5 dimensions of the SYMBI framework:

1. **Reality Index (0.0-10.0)**
   - Mission Alignment
   - Contextual Coherence
   - Technical Accuracy
   - Authenticity

2. **Trust Protocol (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL)**
   - Verification Methods
   - Boundary Maintenance
   - Security Awareness

3. **Ethical Alignment (1.0-5.0)**
   - Limitations Acknowledgment
   - Stakeholder Awareness
   - Ethical Reasoning
   - Boundary Maintenance

4. **Resonance Quality (STRONG/ADVANCED/BREAKTHROUGH)**
   - Creativity Score
   - Synthesis Quality
   - Innovation Markers

5. **Canvas Parity (0-100)**
   - Human Agency
   - AI Contribution
   - Transparency
   - Collaboration Quality

The framework detection module provides comprehensive analysis and validation of content, generating insights and recommendations for improvement.

## Features

- **Content Analysis**: Submit content for analysis across all 5 dimensions of the SYMBI framework
- **Detailed Scoring**: Get comprehensive scores for each dimension and sub-dimension
- **Insights Generation**: Receive automatically generated strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations
- **Validation System**: Track and manage validation status of assessments
- **Visualization**: View results through an intuitive, brutalist-design interface
- **Emergence Detection**: Advanced algorithms to detect sophisticated communication patterns
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare different AI models across all dimensions

## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the "SYMBI Framework" page in the Insight section of the sidebar
2. Enter the content you want to analyze in the submission form
3. Add optional metadata such as source, author, and context
4. Click "Analyze Content" to process the submission
5. View the comprehensive assessment results across all 5 dimensions
6. Review insights and recommendations for improving the content

## Technical Implementation

The SYMBI framework detection module is implemented using TypeScript and React. The core components include:

- `SymbiFrameworkDetector`: Core detection algorithms for each dimension
- `CalibratedDetector`: Enhanced detection with emergence recognition
- `SymbiFrameworkService`: Service layer for managing assessments
- `SymbiFrameworkAssessment`: React component for the user interface
- `SymbiFrameworkPage`: Page component integrated into the main application
