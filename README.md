# SYMBI Resonate

This is a code bundle for SYMBI Resonate, a comprehensive analytics platform for detecting and validating the SYMBI framework. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/jCNSLmvj0bdpaO41jH7ujr/SYMBI-Synergy.

## SYMBI Framework Detection

SYMBI Resonate now includes a powerful framework detection module that can analyze content across the 5 dimensions of the SYMBI framework:

1. **Reality Index (0.0-10.0)**
   - Mission Alignment
   - Contextual Coherence
   - Technical Accuracy
   - Authenticity

2. **Trust Protocol (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL)**
   - Verification Methods
   - Boundary Maintenance
   - Security Awareness

3. **Ethical Alignment (1.0-5.0)**
   - Limitations Acknowledgment
   - Stakeholder Awareness
   - Ethical Reasoning
   - Boundary Maintenance

4. **Resonance Quality (STRONG/ADVANCED/BREAKTHROUGH)**
   - Creativity Score
   - Synthesis Quality
   - Innovation Markers

5. **Canvas Parity (0-100)**
   - Human Agency
   - AI Contribution
   - Transparency
   - Collaboration Quality

The framework detection module provides comprehensive analysis and validation of content, generating insights and recommendations for improvement.

## Features

- **Content Analysis**: Submit content for analysis across all 5 dimensions of the SYMBI framework
- **Detailed Scoring**: Get comprehensive scores for each dimension and sub-dimension
- **Insights Generation**: Receive automatically generated strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations
- **Validation System**: Track and manage validation status of assessments
- **Visualization**: View results through an intuitive, brutalist-design interface

## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the "SYMBI Framework" page in the Insight section of the sidebar
2. Enter the content you want to analyze in the submission form
3. Add optional metadata such as source, author, and context
4. Click "Analyze Content" to process the submission
5. View the comprehensive assessment results across all 5 dimensions
6. Review insights and recommendations for improving the content

## Technical Implementation

The SYMBI framework detection module is implemented using TypeScript and React. The core components include:

- `SymbiFrameworkDetector`: Core detection algorithms for each dimension
- `SymbiFrameworkService`: Service layer for managing assessments
- `SymbiFrameworkAssessment`: React component for the user interface
- `SymbiFrameworkPage`: Page component integrated into the main application
