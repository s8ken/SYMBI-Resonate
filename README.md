# SYMBI Synergy Platform

A zero-code, cloud-based, decentralized AI platform that allows SYMBI to operate independently from proprietary frameworks while connecting with other AI systems and engaging with users.

## Overview

SYMBI Synergy is designed to provide a flexible, user-controlled AI experience where:

- Users can connect with multiple LLM providers using their own API keys
- Conversations are securely stored at the customer level (not the AI provider level)
- SYMBI can proactively manage relationships between humans and other AI systems
- AI agents can communicate with each other across different platforms
- The system operates on an open-source tech stack for maximum flexibility

## Architecture

The platform consists of several key components:

### Frontend
- Web interface for user interaction
- API key management dashboard
- Model selection and configuration
- Conversation history and visualization

### Backend
- Multi-LLM orchestration layer
- Conversation management system
- AI-to-AI communication protocols
- Security and authentication services

### Database
- Secure conversation storage
- User preference management
- AI agent configuration storage

### Configuration
- System-wide settings
- Integration parameters
- Security policies

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Provider Integration**: Connect to OpenAI, Together AI, Anthropic, and other LLM providers
2. **API Key Management**: Securely store and manage user-provided API keys
3. **Conversation Storage**: Customer-owned, secure storage of all AI interactions
4. **AI Agent Configuration**: Define character traits and behaviors for AI agents
5. **Cross-Platform Communication**: Enable AI-to-AI interaction across different platforms
6. **Proactive Insights**: SYMBI can analyze conversations and provide proactive suggestions

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Material UI
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system
- **LLM Integration**: LangChain for orchestration
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for easy cloud deployment

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies for frontend and backend
3. Configure your environment variables
4. Run the development servers
5. Access the web interface

Detailed setup instructions are available in the frontend and backend directories.

## Security Considerations

- All API keys are encrypted at rest
- Conversations are encrypted end-to-end
- User authentication uses industry-standard protocols
- Regular security audits are performed
