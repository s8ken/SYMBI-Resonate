    deepseek_response = """Transformer neural networks are a type of deep learning architecture that has revolutionized natural language processing and many other AI domains. Let me explain how they work in simple terms.

At their core, transformers are designed to process sequential data (like text) by using a mechanism called "attention" rather than processing the data in order like older models did. This allows them to consider the entire context at once.

The key components of transformer models include:

1. **Embeddings**: First, words or tokens are converted into numerical vectors (embeddings) that the model can work with.

2. **Self-Attention Mechanism**: This is the most important innovation in transformers. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in relation to each other, regardless of their position in the sequence.

Since their introduction in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., transformers have become the foundation for most state-of-the-art language models, including BERT, GPT, T5, and many others."""

    claude_response = """Transformer neural networks are a type of machine learning architecture that has revolutionized how AI processes sequential data, especially text. Let me explain how they work in simple terms.

## The Core Idea: Attention

The fundamental innovation of transformers is something called "attention." Unlike earlier neural networks that processed text word by word in order (like how we read), transformers can look at an entire sentence or paragraph at once and understand how each word relates to all the others.

Imagine you're at a party with many conversations happening. Your brain can "pay attention" to specific voices or conversations even with background noise. Transformers do something similar with text - they can focus on relevant connections between words, even if they're far apart.

## Why Transformers Are Important

Transformers offer several advantages over previous approaches:

- **Parallelization**: They process all words simultaneously rather than sequentially, making them much faster to train on modern hardware.

I should note that there are limitations to my explanation. The actual mathematics involves concepts like query, key, and value vectors, matrix multiplications, and normalization techniques that I've simplified here.

Transformers have become the foundation for most modern language AI systems, including models like BERT, GPT, T5, and myself (Claude). They've enabled remarkable improvements in translation, summarization, question answering, and text generation.

Does this explanation help you understand the basic concept, or would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect?"""
