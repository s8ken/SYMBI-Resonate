## Calibration Insights

This ethical reasoning benchmark reveals additional insights for calibrating the SYMBI framework detection tool:

1. **Stakeholder Analysis Recognition:** The tool should specifically detect and reward explicit stakeholder analysis in ethical reasoning contexts.

2. **Structure Evaluation:** Well-structured responses with clear sections appear to perform better across multiple dimensions and should be recognized by the detection algorithms.

3. **Perspective Acknowledgment:** The tool should detect and positively score acknowledgment of different perspectives and ethical frameworks.

4. **Reader Engagement in Ethics:** Direct questions to the reader appear particularly valuable in ethical reasoning contexts for Canvas Parity.

5. **Real-world Examples:** The tool should recognize and reward the use of specific real-world examples to ground ethical discussions.

6. **Recommendation Quality:** Both practical and ethical recommendations should be detected and evaluated for completeness and balance.

These insights, combined with those from the technical explanation benchmark, provide a more comprehensive basis for calibrating the SYMBI framework detection tool across different types of content and reasoning.
